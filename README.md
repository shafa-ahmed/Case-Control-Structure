# Case-Control-Structure
You can use multiple if...elif statements to perform a multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution, especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single variable.  Shell supports case...esac statement which handles exactly this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated if...elif statements.
